# Seefood

The Seefood app Erlich Bachman wanted Jian Yang to make.

Built using CRA with React hooks. You can visit the standalone client side app without any back-end logic, routing, authentication/authorization etc. [here](https://seefood.netlify.app/)

Click log-in to access what would be a protected route where users can perform searches, and simply copy paste any image of food items.
